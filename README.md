the sequel that no one asked for

So, I program in a cromebook with linux, but it is buggy as hell.

So one day my VScode crashed, leading me into a rabbit hole that ended up destroying my files.

That is not happening again.

Do whatever you want with this, but I doubt you even would consider using it for something somewhat useful.
